  - Modes:
    . Marathon - name as much countries you can in  your selected continent.
      - Add Timer? Also should name all countries in entire world, rather than selected continent, since some continents have fewer than others.
    . Quiz - given a continent name an area in it, if you can't you lose.
     - Capitals too maybe?
