# Geography-Name-Game
New Project by Harold Pham and Kevin Xu created after the Checkers-Visual Project.

This game provides a way to train the user's geographical skills by giving them multiple options between continents, and then letting the user input state/country names until
they can't remember anymore. In a way it is like a Geography Marathon.
